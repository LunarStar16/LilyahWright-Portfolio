        <div class="statement"><p>I like to create art in all different kinds of forms, whether that be 2d, 3d or even with words. Creativity and storytelling through as many ways possible is what I like to do, if that be concept art, writing, 3d modelling, animation, or even through coding. Which is why I love video games since so many aspects of what I like to do goes into making them. My favorite video game genre is fantasy and my biggest inspiration for my art is The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, where its fantasy world allowed me to escape from my own into a land filled with magic and dragons, where I can be who I want within its fantasy setting. Fantasy allowed me to escape from my own world and let me be who I want to be, which is why I love it so much, whether it’s the more stereotypical medieval style, or a more futuristic sci-fi, all types of fantasy are what inspire my art and creativity.</p></div>

            <p>This was an animation project I did to learn how to make a character physically move through the enviornment. The walk its self is meant to show a happy motion through the walk as well as the facial expressions, the animation ends with a surprise with a giant object falling in front of the character.</p>
